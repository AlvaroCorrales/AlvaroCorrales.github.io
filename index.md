Welcome to my personal website! My name is Álvaro and I am a Data Scientist, currently working at IBM. An Economist by background, I am primarily interested in the intersection between traditional Econometrics and modern applications in Data Science and AI, such as causal inference. 

I am an enthusiast of data evangelisation, blogging and general scientific and cultural communications. As suhc, I have built this website to collect in a single repository all the pieces of work that I have published in different channels. Here, you will find content about Data Science and Economics, my two areas of professional specialisation, but also about some of my hobbies. This includes the podcast "La Albiónica", where we talk about ancient books, history and Greco-Roman mythology. 

This website is in constant development. In fact, it is a learning project for me, so don't be surprised if it looks entirely different if you revisit it in a matter of days!
