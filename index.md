Welcome to my personal website! My name is Álvaro and I am a Senior Data Scientist. An Economist by background, I am primarily interested in the intersection between traditional Econometrics and modern applications in Data Science and AI, such as causal inference and time series analysis. I also have a big love for words, so I am a big fan of all things NLP. 

I am an enthusiast of data evangelisation, blogging and general scientific and cultural communication. As such, I have built this website to collect in a single repository all the pieces of work that I have published in different channels. Here, you will find content about Data Science and Economics, my two areas of professional specialisation, but also about some of my hobbies. This includes the podcast "[La Albiónica](/_pages/podcast/)", where we talk about ancient books and history. 

This website is in constant development. In fact, it is a learning project for me, so don't be surprised if it looks entirely different if you revisit it in a matter of days! 

> I am currently on a career break. I am spending my time travelling the world, learning about new cultures and languages, reading (mostly history) books, and enjoying nature. I will be looking for positions at the intersection of Economics and Data Science **starting in Summer 2024**.
