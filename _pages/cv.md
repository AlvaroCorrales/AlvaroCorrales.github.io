**TL;DR**. 
Data Scientist with 7 years of experience working with clients in the UK and Spain. I specialise in the development of PoCs and MVPs using AI and Cloud technologies, collaborating with cross-functional teams in sectors such as banking, telecommunications, and the public sector.

With over 30 collaborations for more than 15 clients in the last three years, some of my projects include developing NLP models for identifying malpractice in IT reports, creating a tool for transcribing customer calls for subsequent analysis, and building dashboards for KPI visualisation.

I specialize in econometric techniques for time series analysis, causal inference, natural language processing (NLP), and data visualisation. My programming language is Python, and I have experience with cloud technologies (IBM), visualization tools (Cognos Analytics), and databases (Mongo, Db2).

<!-- ## Technical stack
### Methods
As a Data Scientist, my experience encompases **Machine Learning** techniques such as:
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** - Topic Modelling (LDA), Sentiment analysis (Watson NLU), Embeddings (doc2vec, word2vec), Language Models (see my [article](https://towardsdatascience.com/assyrian-or-babylonian-language-identification-in-cuneiform-texts-4f15a14a5d70) in Towards Data Science)
- **Supervised learning** algorithms such as linear and logistic regression, SVM, KNN, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting
- **Clustering methods** such as Hierarchical clustering and K-Means

As an economist, I have extensive training in the field of **Econometrics**. Some of the techniques I specialise in include:
- **Causal inference** - Panel data, Randomised Controlled Trials (RCT), regression discontinuity
- **Discrete choice** - Classification problems, including multinomial and ordered probit/logit
- **Time series** - Forecasting, Statistical Analysis, ARIMA
- **Duration analysis**

### Technologies
**Python** is my main coding language. Some of the libraries that I typically use in my projects include:
- Data wrangling: *numpy, pandas, scipy*
- Machine and deep learning: *scikit-learn, statsmodels, pytorch, xgboost, lightgbm, skforecast*
- Visualisation and dashboarding: *matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, streamlit*
- NLP: *gensim, nltk, spacy*

As part of my job at IBM, I am also familiar with **Cloud** technologies such as IBM Cloud and Cloud Pak for Data, as well as some knowledge of Docker. 

I am also familiar with Stata, Excel, R, Spark and SQL. 

## Professional Experience
### [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/client-engineering)
Pre-sales development of PoCs with AI and Cloud technologies for clients in the banking, telco and public sector, using an Agile framework.

**Senior Data Scientist â€“ AI Team Community Lead**, Client Engineering Team, London, Oct 2022 - Sep 2023

- Supported the delivery of +30 projects for +15 clients, including PoCs, MVPs, workshops and demos. Engaged with C-level stakeholders, department leaders and development teams.
- Internal Management: AI Community Lead of a ~15-people team; Designed and conducted recruitment process; Mentoring; Knowledge management.

Selected projects:
- **Banking sector** - Led a team to create an algorithm for identifying non-compliant IT controls for a major UK bank using a sentence encoding model, a BERT-based entity extraction model and logical rules. The project resulted in a two-order-of-magnitude increase in controls processed.
- **Banking sector** - Led the development of a data governance framework for a major UK bank including business terms, categories, data privacy rules, and automated data quality assessments.


**Data Scientist**, Client Engineering Team, London, Apr 2021 - Sep 2022

Selected projects:
- **Banking sector** - Led a team for the creation of a tool for auditing customer calls for a major UK bank using a custom speech-to-text model and a BERT-based model for entity extraction and sentiment analysis. The tool improved up to 15 p.p. the transcription accuracy over the existing solution.
- **Public sector** - Developed a dashboard for an NHS trust in the UK to visualise internal governance metrics and predict future performance using time series models. 


**Data Scientist**, Cloud Pak Acceleration Team, London, Nov 2019 - Mar 2021
- **Emergent Alliance** -  Led two teams producing open-source material in the fight against Covid-19. The code is available on [Github](https://github.com/emergent-analytics/workstreams).
  - Co-authored a model of the economy to study how economic shocks propagate across economic sectors and built an web app to interact with it. The Alliance was very satisfied with the final version of the tool. It is now one of its flagship products, available through this [link](https://emergentalliance.org/products-and-services/economic-engine/). 
  - Identified mental health problems and perception of vaccines for NHS on Twitter using topic modelling (LDA), sentiment analysis (Watson NLU) and LSTM.
- **Publishing sector** - Created a ML pipeline to identify authors of comments on various online forums using doc2vec and K-means clustering.
- **Energy sector** â€“ Improved the data collection and organisation process of a company by using a harmonised catalogue with data protection rules, which can be partially accessed by external users, as required by national regulations.

### [Charles River Associates](https://ecp.crai.com/) 
**Consulting Associate, Competition Practice**, London, Aug 2018 - Jul 2019 

Worked in mergers and abuse of dominance cases.

- Worked on other confidential cases in the tech, air transport and natural gas sectors in front of the UKâ€™s and the EUâ€™s competition authorities. 
- Responsibilities ranged from analysing large datasets in Python and Stata to drafting economic reports to be presented as evidence in my cases.

### [Neovantas Consulting](https://www.neovantas.com/en/home/)
**Business Analyst**, Madrid, Jan 2016 - Aug 2017 

- **Banking sector** â€“ Led a lighthouse project for the design and implementation of debt recovery strategy for a collection agency using speech analytics and econometric techniques.

## Languages
I love learning languages! I think it's beautiful how much one can learn from a place and its culture from its language. I am a native **Spanish** speaker. After living in several English-speaking countries for several years, I am fully proficient in **English**. I also have an intermediate level of **French** (just need to clean off the rust!). During the year I spent in Barcelona, I was able to learn some Catalan on my own.
