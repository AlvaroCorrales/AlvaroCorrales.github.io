**TL;DR**. I currently work as a Data Scientist at IBM, with over 4 years of experience in client-facing roles. I specialise in a wide array of Econometric and Data Science techniques including causal inference, discrete choice models, time series and duration analysis. 

After 2.5 years in management and economic consulting, in mid-2019 I decided to pursue a career in Data Science. By that time, Data Science had become an exciting and innovative field, as well as a meeting point for people with very diverse backgrounds with plenty of room for cross-disciplinary collaboration.

## Technical stack
### Methods
My main area of expertise is **Econometrics**. Some of the techniques I specialise in include:
- **Causal inference** - Panel data, RCT, regression discontinuity
- **Discrete choice** - Classification problems, including multinomial and ordered probit/logit
- **Time series** - ARIMA, GARCH
- **Duration analysis**

As a Data Scientist, my experience also encompases other **Machine Learning** techniques, including:
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** - Sentiment analysis, Topic modelling
- **Supervised learning** algorithms such as linear and logistic regression, SVM, KNN, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting
- **Clustering methods** such as Hierarchical clustering and K-Means

I love working with data, and so I love expanding my knowledge with new techniques. Some of my current interests are in the field of **Deep learning** (CNN, LSTM) and **Bayesian Methods**. I recently published a blog about Bayesian Networks in [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/applying-bayesian-networks-to-covid-19-diagnosis-73b06c3418d8).

### Technologies
**Python** is my main coding language. Some of the libraries that I typically use in my projects include:
- Data wrangling: *numpy, pandas, scipy*
- Machine and deep learning: *scikit-learn, statsmodels, keras, xgboost, lightgbm*
- Visualisation and dashboarding: *matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, streamlit*
- NLP: *gensim, nltk, spacy*

As part of my job at IBM, I am also familiar with some **Cloud** technologies such as IBM Cloud and Cloud Pak for Data, as well as some basic knowledge of Docker. 

I am also familiar with Stata, Excel and the basics of R. 

## Professional Experience
### [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/uk-en/garage)
**Data Scientist** | London | November 2019 - Present

Helping organisations use their data with Cloud technology, AI and an Agile methodologies. Show the value of IBM’s Cloud Pak for Data through PoC and MVP. Some projects include:

- **Emergent Alliance** -  Led two teams producing open-source material in the fight against Covid-19. The code is available on [Github](https://github.com/emergent-analytics/workstreams).
  - Co-authored a model of the economy to study how economic shocks propagate across economic sectors and built an web app to interact with it. The Alliance was very satisfied with the final version of the tool. It is now one of its flagship products, available through this [link](https://emergentalliance.org/products-and-services/economic-engine/). 
  - Identified mental health problems and perception of vaccines for NHS on Twitter using topic modelling and sentiment analysis.
- **Publishing industry** - Demonstrated how to leverage NLP and clustering techniques to identify authors of comments in online forums that use different user names across several platforms. 
- **Energy sector** – Improved the data collection and organisation process of a company by using a harmonised catalogue with data protection rules, which can be partially accessed by external users, as required by national regulations.

**Give back**
- I have spoken in public events with organisations such as Code First Girls and PyData London, for which I have achieved recognition as a public [speaker](https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/f94d74c3-e287-4a33-947e-1982c5ee4432/public_url) and [teacher](https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/dd074e83-1583-4f46-bc08-bfef41fe8d3d/public_url).
- Mentoring people that want to start a career as a Data Scientist, for which I have also gained [recognition](https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/e48a1e85-043a-4d69-84f7-372072a03248/public_url).
- I publish blogs about Data Science with my IBM [Medium account](https://medium.com/@alvaro.corrales.cano).

### [Charles River Associates](https://ecp.crai.com/) 
**Consulting Associate, Competition Practice** | London | August 2018 - July 2019

## Languages
I love learning languages! I think it's beautiful how much one can learn from a place and its culture from its language. I am a native **Spanish** speaker. After living in several English-speaking countries for several years, I am fully proficient in **English**. I also have an intermediate level of **French** (just need to clean off the rust!). During the year I spent in Barcelona, I was able to learn some Catalan on my own.
