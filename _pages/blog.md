Whether it is for fun or as part of my job, I love writing and sharing knowledge - although sometimes I don't have as much time as I would like to do it! In this page, you will find some of my latest blog posts about Data Science. Any feedback is welcome!

## Personal
Some of my articles have made it to the Editors' Picks and Hands-on Tutorials section of [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/), Medium's most famous publication on Data Science and AI.

## As part of IBM

As part of the [Emergent Alliance project](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/journey-to-ai/2021/03/ibm-rolls-royce-and-emergent-alliance-further-covid-19-response-with-analytics-toolsets/), I had the opportunity to participate in a number of events: 

- On March 2021, I gave a presentation at the IBM-sponsored event "Chat with the Lab". The recording of the presentation, titled _How Data Science can help governments fight Covid-19: DSE Presents Chat with the Lab_ can be accessed on demand in this [link](https://ibm.webcasts.com/starthere.jsp?ei=1433531&tp_key=0692888bdc).

- As part of the IBM team working with the Emergent Alliance, I presented some of our work in the November 2020 edition of the PyData Berlin Meetup. Click on the image below to watch the recording of the session.
