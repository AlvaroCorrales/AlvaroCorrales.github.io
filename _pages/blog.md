Whether it is for fun or as part of my job, I love writing and sharing knowledge - although sometimes I don't have as much time as I would like to do it! In this page, you will find some of my latest blog posts about Data Science. Any feedback is welcome!

## Personal
### Medium articles
I recently opened a personal Medium account. Some of my articles have made it to the Editors' Picks and Hands-on Tutorials section of [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/), a popular Data Science publication on Medium with over 580K followers.

## As part of IBM
### Events and presentations
- On March 2021, I gave a presentation at the IBM-sponsored event "Chat with the Lab". The recording of the presentation, titled _How Data Science can help governments fight Covid-19: DSE Presents Chat with the Lab_ can be accessed on demand in this [link](https://ibm.webcasts.com/starthere.jsp?ei=1433531&tp_key=0692888bdc).

- As part of the IBM team working with the Emergent Alliance, I presented some of our work in the November 2020 edition of the PyData Berlin Meetup. Click on the image below to watch the recording of the session.
