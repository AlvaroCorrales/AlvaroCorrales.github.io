Whether it is for fun or as part of my job, I love writing - although sometimes I don't have as much time as I would like to do it! In this page, you will find some of my latest blog posts about Data Science. Any feedback is welcome!

## Personal
### Medium articles
I recently opened a personal Medium account. My first article made it to the Editors' Picks and Hands-on Tutorials section of [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/), a popular Data Science publication on Medium with over 580K followers.

## As part of IBM
### Events and presentations
As part of the IBM team working with the [Emergent Alliance](https://emergentalliance.org/), I presented some of our work in the November 2020 edition of the PyData Berlin Meetup. Click on the image below to watch the recording of the session.

### Medium articles
IBM is comitted to sharing knowledge with the broader Data & AI community. As an IBM employee, I have shared my work on Medium publications such as [IBM Data and AI](https://medium.com/ibm-data-ai) and [IBM Garage](https://medium.com/ibm-garage).

- [**Causal analysis of the impact of lockdown measures on economic activity**](https://emergentalliance.org/causal-analysis-of-the-impact-of-lockdown-measures-on-economic-activity/). In this piece of work for the [Emergent Alliance](https://emergentalliance.org/), we show how one can isolate the causal impact of different lockdown measures on social and economic indicators such as energy consumption and people's mobility.
